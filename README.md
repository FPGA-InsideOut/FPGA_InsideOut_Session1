FPGA InsideOut Session1

This is FPGA implementation of "1bit" and "2bit" CRC circuits on FPGA.
Use the source code from this repository if you want to replicate the exercise demonstrated in this video yourself:

To start implementing on "Intel FPGA MAX10 DE10-Lite board", start with a corresponding "DE10_LITE_Golden_Top_patch" file that you can find in "1bit" and "2bit" directories. 

Have fun!
